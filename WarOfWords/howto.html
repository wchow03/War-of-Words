Vancouver, BC has been pinpointed as a place of interest by some of the strongest countries in the world. It is your job, as a cryptographer, to intercept incoming missiles and redirect them away from Burnaby Mountain, to protect the land that may potentially house thousands of talented computer science students.<br><br>

                    Your goal for each stage is to recognize the encryption pattern(s) used to generate the gibberish seen in incoming attacks, and reverse-engineer the message into a real word/phrase. <br><br>
                    
                    You should also be warned that the Allies (USA, UK, France, China, Russia) are displeased by the idea of building universities on mountains, giving them more the reason to attack us with stronger weapons. However, thanks to insider information from spies, we've created a manual with the Allies' most common encryption methods. Flip through the manual to find a way to decipher the attack. It was found that each country utilizes one out of two possible encryptions, so it is important to check BOTH cases as quickly as possible to decide which cipher is a ruse, and which one is legitimate!<br><br>
                    
                    Each correct answer will increase the duration of the game, while wrong answers will deplete health points.</span></h6></div>
